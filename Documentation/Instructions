There are 4 parts to this assessment:

• Extending the vehicle class to show when the vehicle was last serviced, print the total revenue, and distance since the 
  last service

• Create the PerKmRental class that tracks cost of renting the car, has a default cost of $1 per day,
  stores the charging rate, and has a constructor that accepts the distance traveled.

• Create the PerDayRental class that tracks the cost of renting per day (default of $100 per day), has a constructor that
  accepts the distance traveled AND the number of days the car was rented, and can hold the charge rate.

• Creating a service class that records the service for the vehicle class.

The program should also generate errors when renting a car due for service.
